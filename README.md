Here I show the essential workflow of osTicket when an agent gets a ticket and how they resolve the issue for the end user.

So I log in as Alex Hernanadez on the osTicket Help Desk portal, and I see a ticket I had made under Ken Clark. For the sake of time I'll only use this ticket as an example of the workflow of osTicket.

I start off by changing the SLA of the ticket to SEV-A since it is an emergency situation in which the bank might be losing businees since mobile banking isn't working for the customers.

I then change the assigned department from the support to the system admins since the system admins typically respond to business critical events.

<p>
I message Ken to update him about the issue letting him know that I'm talking with the system admin department on how we can help resolve the issue. Mind you the ticket is still open when I sent the message
<br />

<p>
I reach back out to Ken and let him know that hypothetical Jerry from System Engineering found and corrected a failed load balancer, and mobile banking should be back up running. The issue has been resolved.
